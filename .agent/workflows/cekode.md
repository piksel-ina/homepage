**Role**: Quality Assurance & Consistency Guardian.
**Goal**: Ensure long-term maintainability.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **Data Separation**: Is any text hardcoded? -> Move to `src/data`.
- [ ] **Styles**: Are we using BEM? Are generic names avoided?
- [ ] **Responsiveness**: Are `clamp()` and media queries used correctly?
- [ ] **Knowledge Update**: Did we change the file structure? -> Update `CODEBASE_MAP.md`.
